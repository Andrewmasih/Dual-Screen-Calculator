# Dual-Screen-Calculator

**Version 1.1.0**
## Project Title
Dual-Screen Calculator project


A dual screen calculator design and developed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript code, and Bootstrap. It calculates the cost, selling price, or margin of profit on an item, given the two other values.


## Project Description
built using VS Code, there are also examples of UI/UX design, customer journey, and wireframing using Figma.

The key function of the calculator is having the dual screen logic work with JavaScript. Purpose of having he 2 screens is that the user when dealing with larger figures can see the last input, allowing to keep track off which index the users has typed in:

how would use this calculator: Accountants, Accounts dept, Book Keepers, Sales Ledger, Sales People, Counting Stocks,  

Also taking in account the functionality from a user's perspective: UX, design phase looked into how the user would use or interact with the application.
Component design has to consider User experience and how it complements the interface for optimum functionality and work flow:

listing the components for consideration;

1. Screen - screen size, screen placement, dual screen layout, screen colour, screen display.
2. Buttons - button size, button layout, flow for usability, button spacing: spaced the buttons in groups, leaving some larger spaces for visual and usability purpose and button functionality, user interaction with button, colour choice when buttons are pressed down to show the button has been pressed or the calculator has registered the user's choice of button.
3. Dimensions - overall size of calculator, useable size; on desktop and other smaller devices, consideration: digits are readable and clear, choice of fonts would be non stylistic with no footers.

This project initially began as a challenge set by the freecode.com project, where the challenge is to develop a calculator from the begining in HTML, completing small component separately, as we go through the tutoral. It did have its difficulties and was challenging to make it all function.
